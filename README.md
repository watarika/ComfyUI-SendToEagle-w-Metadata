# ComfyUI-SendToEagle-w-Metadata

[English] [<a href="README_ja.md">日本語</a>]

- A custom node for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)
- Sends images with metadata (PNGInfo) obtained from the input values of each node to [Eagle](https://en.eagle.cool/) (image management software)
- You can also add arbitrary `Key:Value` pairs to the metadata
- You can customize the tags to be registered in Eagle
- You can save arbitrary strings and metadata in the Eagle notes field

## Installation

```
cd <ComfyUI directory>/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/watarika/ComfyUI-SendToEagle-w-Metadata.git
```

## List of Custom Nodes

- Send to Eagle With Metadata
- Send to Eagle With Metadata (Extended)
- Create Extra MetaData

## Send to Eagle With Metadata

- Saves the `images` received as input to storage as images with metadata (PNGInfo), and then sends them to Eagle
- For details on the actual metadata added, please refer to [Metadata Added to Images](#metadata-detail)
- If the file format is `png` or `webp`, the workflow is also saved in the image<br>
 Note: If it is `webp` and `lossless`, the workflow may not be saved (under investigation)

### Default Behavior

The default behavior is as follows:<br>
If you want to change these behaviors, use the `Send to Eagle With Metadata (Extended)` node.

- The file name is saved in the format `yyyyMMdd-hhmmss_SSSSSS` + `extension`
  - If the batch size is 2 or more, `(Batch index)` is appended to the end to ensure that images executed in batches have unique file names
- Sent to the default Eagle folder
- Metadata is also saved in the Eagle notes field
- The sampler name is converted to the notation used on Civitai
  - Example: If the sampler is `dpmpp_2m` and the scheduler is `karras`, it becomes `DPM++ 2M Karras`
- The model hash value is not output in the metadata
- Metadata is obtained from the first processed KSampler node

## Supported Nodes and Extensions
- Metadata is obtained from the inputs of the KSampler node found by `sampler_selection_method` and the inputs of previously executed nodes
  - The target KSampler nodes are the keys of `SAMPLERS` in [py/defs/samplers.py](py/defs/samplers.py) and files under [py/defs/ext/](py/defs/ext/)
- Please check the following files for supported nodes.
  - [py/defs/captures.py](py/defs/captures.py)
  - [py/defs/samplers.py](py/defs/samplers.py)
- Please check the following directory for supported extensions.
  - [py/defs/ext/](py/defs/ext/)
